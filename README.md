# Digital Totem 🗿

> **"If you miss a habit, the Totem gets hungry. If it gets hungry, you pay."**

**Digital Totem** is a gamified, shared habit tracker designed for accountability partners (couples or small groups) who want to build rituals together. It replaces boring spreadsheet trackers with a living, breathing digital avatar that reflects your consistency.

## 🌟 The Vision
Traditional habit trackers are lonely. Texts are easy to ignore. The **Digital Totem** sits on your home screen as a shared symbol of your commitment.
- **Do your 5 rituals**: The Totem glows and becomes "Radiant".
- **Miss a ritual**: The Totem shivers, gets "Hungry", and you owe a fine to the "Visit Fund".

## ✨ Key Features
- **👥 Shared Accountability**: Login and see your partner's status instantly.
- **🥚 The Totem**: A reactive avatar (CSS/Framer Motion) that changes mood based on your daily progress.
- **💸 The Visit Fund**: Automated penalty tracking. Miss a day? That's ₹50 into the pot for your next trip/date.
- **🔒 Local & Private**: Currently runs as a Local-First PWA. Your data lives on your device (browser storage).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand (Persisted to LocalStorage)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
